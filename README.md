## Analysis of Environmental Sensor Data using Spark

The goal of the project is to analyse air quality data captured from a network of small environmental sensors, using either the Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark data processing framework. The data can be accessed in JSON format from:
- Averaged data from last 24 hours for each sensor: https://data.sensor.community/static/v2/data.24h.json
- Averaged data from last 5 minutes for each sensor (for testing): https://data.sensor.community/static/v2/data.json
